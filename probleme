This is a file where I write all the problems and beug present in the program

Current problem:
   Cannot subtract a number less than that of a number greater, ie when I subtract (2 - 10), the expected answer should be -8
   so when I enter -8, the program does not continue. Likewise for division, if the answer is a floating point number,
   the program does not continue it is in pause mode and you can enter numbers and press the enter key, it will just keep entering
   and impossible to continue the game.

SOLUTION PROBLEM:
    ...write here the solution of the problem...
